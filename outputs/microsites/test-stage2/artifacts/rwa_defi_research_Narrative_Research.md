# RWA DeFi Research: Narrative Research Notes

## 1. Current Market Narratives

### Key Themes

**Explosive Growth Trajectory**
The RWA DeFi market is experiencing unprecedented expansion, growing from **$8.5B to $19.7B** in 2024 alone. The narrative centers on institutional adoption moving beyond speculative trading toward real utility. The market achieved a **3.4x increase in non-stablecoin AUM** in 2025, with projections suggesting **4x growth in 2026**.

**Infrastructure Maturation**
A critical narrative shift from proof-of-concept to production-ready infrastructure. Security audits, regulatory frameworks, and institutional-grade privacy solutions are enabling real deployment. The **$46 trillion in stablecoin transaction volume** in 2025 demonstrates the foundational infrastructure is robust enough to support tokenized asset settlement.

**Yield Arbitrage as Primary Driver**
The dominant narrative focuses on yield arbitrage opportunities, particularly in tokenized treasuries offering **4-6% returns with 24/7 access** versus traditional T+2 settlement. This represents immediate, tangible value proposition driving adoption.

**Regulatory Clarity Emerging**
The industry narrative is shifting from regulatory uncertainty to active compliance preparation. The transition toward regulated exchanges and automated compliance mechanisms suggests the market is preparing for mainstream adoption.

### Areas of Consensus
- **Scale Projections**: Industry consensus around **$2-4 trillion by 2030** requiring **50-100x growth**
- **Private Credit Opportunity**: Universal agreement that private credit represents the highest growth potential, projected to reach **$150-200B**
- **Infrastructure Readiness**: Consensus that technical infrastructure has matured sufficiently for institutional deployment

### Emerging Trends
- **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Critical for achieving projected scale
