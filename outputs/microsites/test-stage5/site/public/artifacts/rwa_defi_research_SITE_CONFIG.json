  "thesis": "The Real World Asset (RWA) DeFi sector has reached a critical inflection point with over $35 billion in tokenized assets, driven by macro regulatory tailwinds and institutional adoption led by BlackRock's BUIDL fund. The market is evolving from simple asset tokenization to crypto-native composable primitives that leverage unique blockchain features like self-repaying debt mechanisms and automated loan origination. Ritual should immediately engage with high-performing protocols like Zivo and Credit Coop to provide AI-powered loan origination automation and risk analytics, capturing the massive untapped AI integration opportunity in this rapidly maturing sector.",

    },
    {
      "title": "Sophisticated Credit Products Emergence",
      "content": "The market has evolved beyond basic tokenization to include cash flow collateralization, synthetic credit derivatives, and self-repaying loan structures. Protocols like Zivo demonstrate exceptional 3.6% revenue-to-TVL ratios with 95% capital utilization."
