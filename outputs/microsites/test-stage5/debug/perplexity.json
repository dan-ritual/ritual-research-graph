Competitive Analysis\n\n| Entity       | Main Competitors                  | Differentiation Factors |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Provenance** | Solana RWA protocols, DTCC-based tokenization | Native on-chain equity listing with ATS/DeFi lending, $20B loan history, two-way Nasdaq exchangeability[2] |\n| **Plume**    | Insufficient data                | N/A |\n| **Ondo Finance** | Other Treasury tokenizers (e.g., via Aave) | $YLDS stablecoin integration for OUSG, $25M investment fueling RWA-DeFi yield[2] |\n| **BlackRock** | Fidelity, traditional asset managers | Institutional-scale RWA tokenization (real estate/debt) with regulatory compliance edge[1] |\n\nRWA DeFi competitors broadly include Aave ($46.32B TVL), Compound ($2.37B), MakerDAO; differentiation centers on tokenization (equities/Treasuries), institutional partnerships, and MiCA/GENIUS compliance vs. pure lending protocols.[1][2][3]",
