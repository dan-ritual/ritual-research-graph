This leverages Ritual's core AI capabilities while avoiding regulatory complexity of becoming a financial services provider.\n\n### Regulatory Framework\n**Question:** What regulatory and compliance framework does Ritual need to operate in RWA markets without becoming a financial services entity?\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop a compliance framework positioning Ritual as a technology service provider rather than financial services entity. Focus on privacy-preserving AI services that enhance protocol capabilities without making underwriting decisions.\n\n### Value Capture Strategy\n**Question:** How can Ritual capture value from the self-repaying debt mechanism trend without building protocol-specific infrastructure?\n\n**Recommendation:** Develop specialized AI models for cash flow prediction and monitoring across different self-repaying debt applications. Focus on providing analytical infrastructure that enables protocols to scale these mechanisms automatically.\n\n## Partnership Strategy\n\n### Priority Partnerships\n1. **Zivo Protocol:** Highest priority due to clear automation needs and proven unit economics\n2. **Credit Coop:** Focus on enhanced cash flow prediction capabilities for established business clients\n3. **Provenance:** Approach cautiously, focusing on privacy-preserving compliance solutions\n\n### Integration Approach\n- Develop standardized APIs for cash flow analysis across multiple protocols\n- Focus on real-time cash flow monitoring and prediction capabilities\n- Build chain-agnostic AI infrastructure deployable across multiple environments\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Direct Protocol Outreach:** Initiate partnership discussions with Zivo, Credit Coop, and Provenance\n2. **Technical Assessment:** Evaluate integration requirements across target protocols\n3. **Regulatory Consultation:** Develop compliant positioning strategy for AI service provision\n4. **Prototype Development:** Build proof-of-concept integrations with highest-priority protocols"
