# Strategic Questions from RWA DeFi Research Meeting

## How should Ritual position itself in the AI-powered RWA automation stack versus building comprehensive RWA infrastructure?

**Context:** The meeting revealed that most RWA protocols rely on manual processes for loan origination, with only Bid.io attempting AI integration as a specialized oracle. Meanwhile, infrastructure players like Plume and Provenance are building comprehensive RWA-specific chains. This creates a strategic positioning question for Ritual between becoming the "AI layer" for existing protocols versus building a full-stack solution.

**Analysis:** The market presents two distinct approaches. Infrastructure players like Provenance are betting on vertical integration, controlling the entire stack from compliance to settlement. However, their $20 billion TVL claims are unverified by DeFi Llama, suggesting potential market positioning over substance. Conversely, specialized players like Bid.io focus on narrow AI applications but lack the comprehensive capabilities Ritual could provide.

The manual bottlenecks identified in protocols like Zivo (3.6% revenue-to-TVL ratio but manual origination) suggest significant value in horizontal AI services. Zivo's high capital efficiency (95% utilization) demonstrates that automation could unlock substantial TVL growth across multiple protocols rather than requiring Ritual to build protocol-specific infrastructure.

**Implications for Ritual:** Ritual should position as the horizontal AI automation layer, partnering with multiple protocols rather than competing with infrastructure providers. This leverages Ritual's core AI capabilities while avoiding the regulatory complexity of becoming a financial services provider. The strategy should focus on API integrations with high-performing protocols like Zivo and Credit Coop, providing loan origination automation, risk assessment, and cash flow prediction services.

**Open threads:** Need to assess technical integration requirements for existing protocols, evaluate partnership appetite from target protocols, and determine revenue-sharing models that align with protocol economics.

## What regulatory and compliance framework does Ritual need to operate in RWA markets without becoming a financial services entity?

**Context:** The meeting highlighted the tension between regulatory compliance (Provenance's KYC-integrated chain) and accessibility (limiting who can participate). RWAs operate under traditional financial regulations while trying to leverage crypto-native features. The FIT21 Act and pro-crypto administration provide tailwinds, but the specific requirements for AI service providers in this space remain unclear.

**Analysis:** Current approaches show two extremes: Provenance builds compliance directly into their chain architecture, while protocols like Zivo rely on traditional KYC processes that create accessibility barriers. The regulatory landscape appears to be evolving favorably with the FIT21 Act, but AI service providers face unique challenges around data privacy, model transparency, and liability for automated decisions.

Privacy-preserving computation could address the transparency versus compliance tension identified in the meeting. Traditional KYC creates accessibility barriers, but zero-knowledge proofs could enable compliance verification without exposing sensitive data. This represents a potential competitive advantage for Ritual's privacy-focused approach.

The key question is whether Ritual can provide AI services to RWA protocols without triggering financial services regulations. If Ritual provides risk assessment and loan origination automation, it may be considered part of the underwriting process, potentially requiring financial services licensing.

**Implications for Ritual:** Develop a compliance framework that positions Ritual as a technology service provider rather than a financial services entity. Focus on privacy-preserving AI services that enhance protocol capabilities without making underwriting decisions. Consider partnerships with regulated entities to provide compliant AI infrastructure while maintaining regulatory distance from financial decisions.

**Open threads:** Legal analysis of AI service provider requirements in RWA markets, assessment of liability exposure for automated decisions, evaluation of privacy-preserving compliance solutions, and regulatory consultation on positioning strategy.

## How can Ritual capture value from the self-repaying debt mechanism trend without building protocol-specific infrastructure?

**Context:** The meeting identified self-repaying debt mechanisms as a key innovation, with Zivo's merchant cash advance model and Credit Coop's future cash flow collateralization representing "Alchemix-style mechanisms for RWAs." These protocols demonstrate high capital efficiency but face scaling challenges due to manual processes.

**Analysis:** Self-repaying debt represents a fundamental innovation in DeFi, moving beyond traditional collateralization to cash flow-based repayment. Zivo's 3.6% revenue-to-TVL ratio significantly exceeds traditional RWA protocols (1-3% annualized), suggesting superior unit economics. However, both Zivo and Credit Coop rely on manual loan origination and risk assessment processes that limit their scaling potential.

The opportunity lies in providing AI infrastructure that can automate the complex cash flow analysis required for these mechanisms. Traditional credit assessment focuses on static collateral, but self-repaying debt requires dynamic cash flow prediction and real-time monitoring. This creates a unique value proposition for AI services that can process streaming financial data and predict repayment capacity.

The generalizability of these mechanisms across different asset types (merchant sales, salary streams, business revenue) suggests a large addressable market. However, each application requires specialized domain knowledge and risk models.

**Implications for Ritual:** Develop specialized AI models for cash flow prediction and monitoring across different self-repaying debt applications. Focus on providing the analytical infrastructure that enables protocols to scale these mechanisms automatically. Consider building standardized APIs for cash flow analysis that can be integrated across multiple protocols and asset types.

**Open threads:** Technical requirements for real-time cash flow monitoring, partnerships with payment processors and financial data providers, development of specialized AI models for different cash flow types, and integration strategies with existing self-repaying debt protocols.

## What is Ritual's competitive positioning against specialized AI solutions like Bid.io in the RWA risk assessment market?

**Context:** Bid.io emerged as the only direct AI competitor mentioned in the meeting, described as "an AI oracle for pricing risks related to RWA assets" but characterized as "more of a specialization of what we can provide." This suggests Ritual has broader capabilities but raises questions about market positioning and differentiation.

**Analysis:** Bid.io's oracle-focused approach represents a narrow point solution, providing risk pricing data to protocols but not comprehensive automation capabilities. This creates an opportunity for Ritual to provide full-stack AI services including loan origination, risk assessment, cash flow prediction, and portfolio management.

However, Bid.io's specialized focus may provide deeper domain expertise in RWA risk assessment. Oracle services also have clearer value propositions and revenue models compared to broader AI infrastructure plays. The question becomes whether the market values specialized depth or comprehensive breadth in AI services.

The meeting's emphasis on manual processes across multiple protocols suggests demand for comprehensive automation rather than point solutions. Protocols like Zivo need end-to-end AI support, not just risk pricing oracles.

**Implications for Ritual:** Position as the comprehensive AI automation platform for RWA protocols, contrasting with Bid.io's narrow oracle focus. Emphasize full-stack capabilities including loan origination, risk assessment, cash flow prediction, and portfolio optimization. Consider acquiring or partnering with specialized players like Bid.io to combine breadth with depth.

**Open threads:** Detailed competitive analysis of Bid.io's capabilities and market position, assessment of customer preferences for specialized versus comprehensive solutions, evaluation of acquisition opportunities in the AI-RWA space, and development of differentiated value propositions.

## How should Ritual approach the multichain RWA infrastructure landscape while maintaining focus on AI services?

**Context:** The meeting established that "the stack for RWAs is now really multichain" with Ethereum as the institutional settlement layer and specialized L2s like Provenance and Plume emerging. This creates complexity for AI service providers who need to integrate across multiple chains and protocols.

**Analysis:** The multichain reality creates both opportunities and challenges for Ritual. Each chain has different technical requirements, governance models, and protocol ecosystems. Provenance focuses on compliance integration, while Plume emphasizes RWA standardization. Ethereum remains the institutional settlement layer due to BlackRock's endorsement.

The fragmentation suggests demand for cross-chain AI services that can provide consistent automation capabilities across different RWA ecosystems. However, this requires significant technical complexity and resource allocation across multiple blockchain environments.

The alternative approach focuses on the highest-value chains and protocols, potentially missing opportunities but enabling deeper integration and better service quality. Given Ritual's resource constraints, a focused approach may be more effective than broad multichain coverage.

**Implications for Ritual:** Develop a tiered multichain strategy focusing on Ethereum and the highest-TVL L2s first, then expanding to specialized RWA chains. Prioritize protocols with proven traction (like Zivo and Credit Coop) over broad chain coverage. Consider building chain-agnostic AI infrastructure that can be deployed across multiple environments without requiring chain-specific development.

**Open threads:** Technical assessment of integration requirements across different RWA chains, evaluation of TVL and growth potential for each chain, partnership opportunities with multichain infrastructure providers, and resource allocation strategy for multichain development.

## What partnerships and integration strategies should Ritual pursue with high-performing RWA protocols identified in the research?

**Context:** The meeting identified specific high-performing protocols including Zivo (3.6% revenue-to-TVL ratio), Credit Coop (serving major clients like Ramp), and Provenance ($20B claimed TVL). Each represents different partnership opportunities and integration challenges.

**Analysis:** Zivo represents the highest-value partnership opportunity due to their proven unit economics and clear automation needs. Their manual loan origination process directly aligns with Ritual's AI capabilities, and their small scale means partnership could significantly impact their growth trajectory.

Credit Coop offers access to established business clients and proven cash flow collateralization mechanisms. However, their larger scale and existing client relationships may make them less dependent on external AI services.

Provenance presents the largest potential market opportunity but also the highest complexity due to their comprehensive compliance requirements and unverified TVL claims. Partnership would require navigating their existing infrastructure and regulatory framework.

The partnership strategy must balance potential impact, technical complexity, and competitive positioning. Early partnerships with smaller, high-performing protocols may provide better learning opportunities and case studies for larger partnerships.

**Implications for Ritual:** Prioritize partnership discussions with Zivo due to clear value proposition and automation needs. Develop specific integration proposals for Credit Coop focusing on enhanced cash flow prediction capabilities. Approach Provenance partnerships cautiously, focusing on privacy-preserving compliance solutions rather than core protocol functionality.

**Open threads:** Direct outreach to protocol teams for partnership discussions, development of specific integration proposals and value propositions, technical assessment of integration requirements, and partnership structure and revenue-sharing negotiations.
