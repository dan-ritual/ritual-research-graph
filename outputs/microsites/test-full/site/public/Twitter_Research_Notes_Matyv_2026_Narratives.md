# OVERVIEW & MARKET THESIS

## Core Thesis
- "Alt season never came back" is the WRONG question
- **Institutions arrived to deploy capital SELECTIVELY** - not to speculate
- Retail never fully returned
- Liquidity didn't flood - it ROTATED from narrative to narrative
- **This cycle rewards PROOF, not belief**: Real users, real utility, real revenue
- Projects need to be treated more like stocks: revenue, strong metrics, real use cases
- Token value accrual matters: governance-only tokens (like ARB) questioned
- **Buybacks and burning mechanisms based on revenue** = real value accrual

## Tier List (Market Outlook)
| Tier | Narratives |
|------|------------|
| **S** | AI, RWAs, Prediction Markets |
| **A** | Privacy, Robotics, Payments/Neobanks |
| **B** | Perp DEXes, L1/L2, DeFi |
| **C** | InfoFi, DePIN, Interoperability |
| **D** | Gaming, Memes, NFTs |

# S-TIER: AI

## Market Analysis
- AI overheated early 2025, prices corrected sharply
- Still one of fastest-growing sectors
- AI models crossed threshold where they can be trusted with meaningful work
- Researchers using for deep reasoning tasks
- "Vibe coding" shift - humans guide systems rather than manually execute
- **Main bottleneck is no longer intelligence - it's VERIFIABILITY**

## Critical Insight: Know Your Agent (KYA)
- Non-human identities already outnumber humans in financial systems
- Most cannot transact, hold value, or be accountable
- **KYA emerging as critical primitive**
- Agents need cryptographically verifiable identities defining:
  - Who they act for
  - What they're allowed to do
  - Who bears liability
- Without this, agents remain blocked at edges of real markets

## Key Development: ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents)
- Mentioned by @AriannaSimpson and @danboneh
- Protocol for agents across different org boundaries
- New x402 payment standards enable agent-to-agent transfers including stablecoins

## AI Commerce Trend
- Large retailers (Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart) creating shared standards
- Universal Commerce Protocol announced by Sundar Pichai
- AI agents shopping on users' behalf

# S-TIER: RWAs (REAL WORLD ASSETS)

## Market Analysis
- **Grew from ~$5B to $20B onchain in 2025**
- Long-term projections: multi-trillion-dollar market
- Still small slice of global equities, bonds, real estate, private credit
- Forecasts: $2T → $15T by 2030 (not adoption - MIGRATION)
- **"Quietly important trade"** - retail attention elsewhere
- BlackRock issuing on-chain funds
- Franklin Templeton running tokenized treasuries

## Critical Insight: Where Value Accrues
- Real upside in INFRASTRUCTURE: compliance, origination, settlement, liquidity
- NOT simply wrapping assets and pushing onchain
- RWAs at intersection of: institutional demand, regulatory clarity, crypto strengths (programmability, global settlement, composability)
- Adoption slower than retail narratives but FAR MORE DURABLE
- Less hype cycle, more STRUCTURAL SHIFT compounding over years

# A-TIER: PRIVACY

## Market Analysis
- For years, transparency was unquestioned virtue
- **Narrative changing**: privacy being repriced as INFRASTRUCTURE, not ideology
- Capital rotated into $XMR, $DASH
- Fully transparent money = liability in world of AI, chain analysis, financial controls
- **Secrets are hard to migrate** - real switching costs emerge
- Crossing privacy boundaries leaks metadata
- Real-world use cases DEMAND confidentiality by default
- Payments, RWAs, wealth management, agent-driven finance need privacy
- Public chains effective for speculation; PRIVATE EXECUTION necessary for scale

## Key Quote (Ali Yahya @alive_eth)
"Privacy will be the most important moat in crypto. Why? Because secrets are hard to migrate."

# C-TIER: INTEROPERABILITY

## Market Analysis
- Solved real problem but no longer compelling investment narrative
- Cross-chain messaging/bridging = baseline infrastructure
- Markets no longer reward for simply existing
- **Token performance reflects this**: underperformed for long stretches
- Weak value capture, ongoing emissions, limited usage-to-token linkage

---

# D-TIER: GAMING

## Market Analysis
- Always framed as natural blockchain use case
- Gaming tokens were among most hyped in retail-driven markets
- High expectations after Off The Grid (new AAA crypto-native bar)
- **BUT this cycle led by institutions, infrastructure, macro - not retail speculation**
- Gaming tokens = highly speculative, opposite end of spectrum
- Token economics often front-run success
- Value priced in before sustainable demand exists

---

# D-TIER: MEMES

## Market Analysis
- Most reflexive corner of crypto - also most fragile
- Barrier to launch = effectively zero
- Explosion of low-effort tokens, insider-heavy launches, coordinated dumps, scams
- **Risk-reward has worsened materially for most participants**
- What was organic community speculation → extraction
- Insiders, snipers, automated launches capture upside early
- Retail liquidity becomes exit
- Average memecoin lifecycle shortened dramatically
- Trust has eroded
- Meme runs will still happen but RISKIER than ever

---

# D-TIER: NFTs

## Market Analysis
- Once cultural center of crypto
- Cultural impact hasn't disappeared - still cool, expressive, meaningful
- **BUT as investment, risk hard to ignore**
- Liquidity thin
- Most promises of utility/benefits remain highly speculative
- This cycle driven by institutions/infrastructure/products with measurable adoption
- NFTs on opposite end of that spectrum

- RWAs ranked S-tier alongside AI
- Infrastructure for compliance, origination, settlement = where value accrues
- Ritual primitives (ONNX for credit scoring, HTTP for off-chain verification) directly applicable

### 4. PRIVACY AS INFRASTRUCTURE
- "Secrets are hard to migrate"
- Privacy emerging as moat in institutional finance
- Ritual's Secret Encryption + TEE = privacy-preserving computation on-chain

### 5. AGENT-TO-AGENT PAYMENTS
- x402 standards, ERC-8004 emerging
- Ritual could enable verified agent actions + payments
- Scheduled Transactions enable autonomous agent operations

### 6. PROOF > BELIEF
- Market rewarding real users, real utility, real revenue
- Ritual enables VERIFIABLE computation - turns AI claims into proof

### 7. INSTITUTIONAL SELECTIVITY
- Institutions deploying capital selectively
- They need infrastructure that provides compliance + verifiability
- Ritual positioned for institutional AI/RWA use cases
