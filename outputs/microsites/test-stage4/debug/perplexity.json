Market Context\n\n**Market size and growth**: DeFi lending TVL reached $58.27B in early 2026, up 6.6% week-over-week, with Aave v3 at $46.32B (79.5% dominance).[3] Total crypto market cap nears $3.3T amid ETF inflows and BTC at $94K.[5] RWA benefits from 40% YoY growth in MiCA-compliant stablecoin cross-border transactions.[1]  \n**Key trends**: Shift to \"On-Chain Finance\" (OnFi) with tokenized assets, institutional credit pools, cross-chain interoperability, and AI risk management; RWA and stablecoins central to DeFi evolution.[1][4] L2 rotations (e.g., Arbitrum +$266M inflows) address scalability.[3]  \n**Regulatory landscape**: U.S. GENIUS Act and EU MiCA drive 2026 growth via stablecoin oversight and compliance, curbing speculation while enabling institutional RWA/DeFi adoption; focus on regulated institutions in DeFi.[1][7]\n\n## 3.
