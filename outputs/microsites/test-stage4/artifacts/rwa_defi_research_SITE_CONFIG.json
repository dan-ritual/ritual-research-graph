  "thesis": "The Real World Assets DeFi market has reached $35 billion in tokenized assets, driven by regulatory tailwinds and institutional adoption led by BlackRock's BUIDL fund. RWAs are transitioning from simple on-chain asset representation to complex, composable DeFi primitives with significant automation and AI integration opportunities. The space is bottlenecked by manual loan origination processes and lacks transparent, on-chain analytics, presenting clear opportunities for Ritual's AI infrastructure.",

      "title": "Market Maturation at Scale",
      "content": "The RWA DeFi market has evolved from experimental overcollateralized lending in 2021 to institutional-grade infrastructure worth $35B+ in 2026. This shift is driven by normalized 4-5% risk-free rates and pro-crypto regulatory frameworks like the FIT21 Act."

      "title": "Self-Paying Debt Innovation",
      "content": "Protocols like Zivo and Credit Coop are pioneering revenue-based repayment mechanisms that automatically deduct loan payments from borrower cash flows. These models show superior unit economics with 3.6% revenue-to-TVL ratios and 95% capital utilization."

      "title": "Manual Process Bottlenecks",
      "content": "Despite strong demand, RWA protocols are constrained by manual loan origination and underwriting processes. This creates clear opportunities for AI-powered automation to scale TVL productivity and reduce operational overhead."

      "title": "Multichain Infrastructure Reality",
      "content": "RWA infrastructure is definitively multichain, with Ethereum serving as the institutional settlement layer while specialized L2s like Provenance and Plume handle compliance and standardization. This fragmentation creates demand for unified cross-chain solutions."
