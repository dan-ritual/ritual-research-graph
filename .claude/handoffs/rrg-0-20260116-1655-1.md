## Context Summary

Completed Ritual Research Graph foundation phase. Created comprehensive specifications for all implementation phases. Made key architecture decisions via elicitation: Supabase for database, Next.js for portal, Google OAuth (@ritual.net), multi-AI research chain (Grok → Perplexity → bird-cli → Claude). Evaluated Railway vs Supabase, decided to keep Supabase for superior auth/RLS integration. Created handoff system for session continuity.

## Progress

- [x] Create project structure and core types
- [x] Create entity registry and index manager
- [x] Import existing RWA microsite
- [x] Create MASTER_SPEC.md with architecture decisions
- [x] Create SPEC_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (Phase 1a)
- [x] Create SPEC_PROCESSING_PIPELINE.md (Phase 1b)
- [x] Create SPEC_MULTI_AI_RESEARCH.md
- [x] Run elicitation for all open questions
- [x] Evaluate Railway vs Supabase (decided Supabase)
- [x] Create handoff system for session continuity
- [ ] Phase 1a: Create Supabase project
- [ ] Phase 1a: Set up database schema
- [ ] Phase 1b: Implement processing pipeline

---

## Next Steps

1. Create new Supabase project for ritual-research-graph
2. Configure Google OAuth with @ritual.net domain restriction
3. Run database migrations from SPEC_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
4. Set up environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
5. Begin Phase 1b: Processing pipeline implementation



---

## Notes

Implementation sequence is: Phase 1a (Database) → Phase 1b (Pipeline) → Phase 2 (Portal) → Phase 3 (Graph UI) → Phase 4 (Spot Treatment). Phases can potentially be parallelized: 1a must complete first, then 1b and 2 could run in parallel. Multi-AI research chain adds Grok, Perplexity, and bird-cli to the processing pipeline.

**Phase:** 0 — Foundation
**Status:** complete

### Context Summary
Completed Ritual Research Graph foundation phase. Created comprehensive specifications for all implementation phases. Made key architecture decisions via elicitation: Supabase for database, Next.js for portal, Google OAuth (@ritual.net), multi-AI research chain (Grok → Perplexity → bird-cli → Claude). Evaluated Railway vs Supabase, decided to keep Supabase for superior auth/RLS integration. Created handoff system for session continuity.

### Files to Read First
